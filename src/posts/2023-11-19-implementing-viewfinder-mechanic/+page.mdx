Recently, I played [Viewfinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/), which is a puzzle game with a really interesting mechanic.
You can take photos of the game world, and later "apply" the photo to replace the world behind it. I thought it would be interesting to try to implement it.
