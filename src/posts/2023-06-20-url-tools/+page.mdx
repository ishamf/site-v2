  A tool to generate URLs with complex parameters. It can also be used to generate and open deep links and generate QR codes.

Construct URLs with recursive parameters,

1. Enter a URL.
2. Add query parameters.
3. If the parameter value is a valid URL, you'll be able to add params to it.
4. If you enter a URL that already has some params, you can parse it.

import PageUI from './PageUI.svelte';

<PageUI client:load />

In my work, sometimes I need to construct complicated URLs with multiple parameters,
and those parameters can be URLs with their own parameters.
There's not really a lot of tools to support this, so I usually have to do the encoding and formatting manually.

Since it seems easy enough to implement, I decided to create one as a post here. I also added a few helpful features.

### Opening as URL

In mobile, copy-pasting the URL in the browser and clicking a link can have different behavior, depending on which app is registered.
So I added a link to test this case.

### Generating QR Code

Another common case is to generate QR code for a URL, to easily open it in a mobile device.

### Sharing a URL to this Page

Sometimes you intend for other people to open the URL. In that case, you can share a link to this page.
